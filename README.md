# ZippersMvc
Date : 16/02/2023
Firstly, I created MVC application with the given product ZIPPERS with the help of ASP.net core 3.1 in visual studio.
Secondly, I include Individual User Accounts authentication and configure for HTTPS.
Then, I created Github repositery for backup my application.
For the supplied product, "Zippers," I created a Model class called "Zippers.cs" and added six attributes to it.
I included Nudget Packages to enhance the functionality of the application. 
Then , I performed a Scaffolding operation in the applicationdbcontext to simplify the development process.
Then, to make the project page easier for website visitors to browse, I changed it.
I modified the title of the real - time inventory page to reflect the name of the fictional company, "ZippersPro," and I added a hyperlink to it. By doing this, I hoped to enhance the user experience and make it easier for visitors to use the navigation panel to access the website's pertinent material. 
The functionality and overall usability of the website were improved by making these adjustments.
Then, I made a "About Us" page that included details about the corporate offices, employees, and fictional firm in addition to a brief summary of the product.
In order to enhance the overall appeal and user experience, I performed tweaks using the "Style.css" file that included the addition of a product image, adjustments to the default style, and usage of special colour preferences and fonts. 
These components were customized to the project's particular visual needs in order to make sure the ultimate result was both aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly.
Next, in the Models/Zippers.cs file, I created a new property named "Rating" and modified the [Bind] attribute in the "ZipperssController.cs" code.
The SeedData.cs, Create.cs, and Index.cs files were then updated to include this information.
After that, I migrated and updated the database.
